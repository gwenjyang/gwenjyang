## Featured Projects

### Research Project: LLM-Based Network Code Generation
AI system generating P4 network programs from natural language. Built intent classifier (TF-IDF + SVM) that improved compilation success 4% to 74% on finetuned LLM. Implementing continuous learning pipeline with MLOps on GCP.

**Focus**: Continuous ML deployment, prompt engineering, model deployment, model validation

### Social Commerce Platform
Full-stack clothing trading platform with React Native mobile app and Node.js backend deployed on AWS.

**Key features**:
* React Native (Expo) frontend with responsive UI for Android
* Node.js/Express REST API with JWT authentication
* PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM for type-safe queries
* Firebase Auth integration with bidirectional user profile sync
* AWS deployment with RDS and S3 using Terraform IaC
* CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions for automated deployments

### Political Reddit Sentiment Analysis
Distributed data pipeline analyzing political discourse across 68K+ Reddit posts from a 13.6TB dataset using PySpark.

**Key features**:
* End-to-end ETL pipeline with PySpark on distributed cluster
* Sentiment analysis using VADER and HuggingFace DistilBERT models
* TF-IDF vectorization with Random Forest classifier (F1: 0.569)
* Optimized with caching strategies and partitioning (53% faster processing)
* Processed and stored results in Parquet format for efficient querying

### Go-Back-N Reliable Transport Protocol
Custom network protocol with AIMD congestion control over UDP. Sliding window implementation with error recovery, checksum verification, configurable packet loss simulation.

**Key features**:
* Three-way handshake for connection establishment
* Sliding window protocol with cumulative ACKs
* AIMD congestion control (additive increase, multiplicative decrease)
* 16-bit checksum validation for error detection
* Configurable packet loss and bit error simulation
* Achieved ~40% link utilization on 20MB file transfers
